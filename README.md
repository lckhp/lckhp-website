## Branching Conventions

To keep our codebase maintainable and comprehensible, we follow specific branching conventions. This section outlines the purpose and naming strategy for each type of branch.

### Main/Master Branch

The `main` or `master` branch is reserved for stable releases.

- **Branch Name:** `rel`

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are used for developing new features and enhancements.

- **Prefix:** `feature/`
- **Naming Convention:** `feature/<user>/<branch-name>`

### Bugfix Branches

Bugfix branches address minor issues and bugs in the codebase.

- **Prefix:** `bugfix/`
- **Naming Convention:** `bugfix/<user>/<branch-name>`

### Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches are for critical fixes that need to be addressed immediately.

- **Prefix:** `hotfix/`
- **Naming Convention:** `hotfix/<user>/<branch-name>`

### Testing Branches

Testing branches are dedicated to testing purposes and should not be merged into the `main` or `master` branch.

- **Prefix:** `test/`
- **Naming Convention:** `test/<user>/<branch-name>`

## Examples

Here are some examples of branch names following our conventions:

- **Feature Branches:**
  - `feature/aarush/user-login`
  - `feature/aarati/dashboard`
- **Bugfix Branches:**
  - `bugfix/aarush/view-changes`
- **Hotfix Branches:**
  - `hotfix/enji/critical-login-issue`
